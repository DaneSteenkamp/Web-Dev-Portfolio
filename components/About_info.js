      Hello I am a creative thinker that has been exposed to multitude of design
      disciplineâ€™s over my 10-year career. Such as Draughting, 3d Design
      Rendering, Graphic Design, Exhibition Design, CNC Programing and Furniture
      production. As well as my passion for Design I have always had a keen
      interest in computers and all things Tech. Therefore I have enrolled and
      am currently completing my Web Development Boot camp with HyperionDev. I
      look forward using my Design knowledge and development skill to design and
      implement aesthetically pleasing and functional web sites and
      applications.
